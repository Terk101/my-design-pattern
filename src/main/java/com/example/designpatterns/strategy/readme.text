The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.

Strategy Design Pattern
-Behavioral software design pattern
-Family of algorithms
-Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime

-Compatible with Open/Closed Principle
-Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

Composition rather than inheritance.
